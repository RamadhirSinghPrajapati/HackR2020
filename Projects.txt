

       Text summarization  and  sentiments predictions using deep learning 



     Create a web UI that will ask for topic name 


     It must search on wiki 


     Scrape the data from wiki and store it permanently 


     Use NLP to summarize the topic or data you just searched

     Topic category is like , political , socical , flood etc 





    2.     Create AI chatbot as your personal assistance  


     Create webUI where you can chat with your bot


     Bot must be oriented to your personal life problems


     Define your personal intentes in chatbot 


     You can use any of the bots platform like dialog flow , rasa , watson etc.


    You need to collect the answer by bots and create a song recommendation from youtube 


    Play that song and change it according to your chats 


    Maintain user history in your webUI 











    3.    Heart disease prediction and recommendation of nearby doctors


    Create web UI that will take symptom as checkbox in html


    Make sure it is already pre trained from some datasets


    Datasets you can find in google or kaggle 


    After prediction of heart disease 


    Ask for your location and search the best doctor 


    Recommend that doctor with their address and contact details 


    Take feedback from that user and maintain your own data for next time recommendation 


    Make all this on top of aws cloud 


    .Use any of the best supervised learning algo and process the result after comparing the accuracy score 








    4.    Save electricity by prediction tubelight or bulb status  


     Create webui that will turn on camera and check for human presence 


    If there is no human then check for tube light status 


    Tube light status check be check by light intensity 


    If tube light is on generate voice note 


     Send email or whatsapp message to register user 


     Show the graph of  performance of your code


     In every 10 days  








    5.   Hand gesture based task automation 


     Create a webUI  to perform below given task 


     Use hand gesture signs according to perform operations 


     Take picture when at least 3 humans are there 


     With some hand gesture play music 


     Hand gesture with start taking voice input and do some task


     Take picture and post in fb


      Do any 5 object detection 





    6.    Computer vision for sentiment analysis  using facial expression


    Allow camera to take data form user input


    Apply deep learning here


    Analysis sentiment with respect to their facial expression 


    Show face expression type on rectangle box 


    Play youtube music accordingly 









    7.   AI search for finding criminals


      Train your system to recognize the particular faces


      Train at least 10 most popular criminal 


       Now take a group of pictures and find that criminal 


       Check the accuracy 


       You can use  any of the popular deep learning library for face recognition


    After finding criminal recommend the worst jail for that criminal 


    Make sure you have a proper UI for that where you can upload and analyze all these things





    8.    AI  face meter that will predict your face during age of period


     Take image as input and detect face


     Show the range of age as slide meter 


     Predict the face as per the age meter 


     Save all the processing  images





            9.    AI human face analysis 


    Create a web ui where you can upload or live stream images


    Identify all the humans 


    Identify their age and gender 


    Identify spike 


    Color of eyes
